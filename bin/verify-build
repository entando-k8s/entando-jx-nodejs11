#Jenkins X lacks "onFailure" steps. For this reason, we are forced to let the main build succeed, stash the build output
#to our DevOps results storage in Github, and then inspect the build output to fail if our fail fast criteria have
#not been met.
#Currently we only check for Failsafe or Surefire failures, but we may want to extend this to fail on other criteria too
